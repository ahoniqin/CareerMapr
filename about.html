        <p>For the Canadian Open Data Experience, our team identified labour market competition as a barrier to youth employment. This stumbling block can mean less competitive pay for youth starting out and longer wait times before starting their careers. Our app CareerMapr gives choice back to Youth looking to get a jumpstart on their careers with opportunities across Canada.</p>

        <h4>OUR PROCESS</h4>

        <p>We focused on datasets that helped us define three important factors that job finders consider  when looking to find the most value for their skills. We identified these factors as average salary, cost of living and number of  job openings in the intended industry. We ranked cities based on a formula that weighed each factor differently.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Data sets:</p>
        <p><a href="http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&retrLang=eng&id=2820069&paSer=&pattern=&stByVal=1&p1=1&p2=37&tabMode=dataTable&csid=" class="datalink">Labour force survey estimates (LFS)</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/4e3b1c7a-a0ad-4a9f-805d-3a9d812c9460" class="datalink">Average household expenditures, by selected metropolitan area</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/141212/t141212a003-eng.htm" class="datalink">Number of job vacancies and job vacancy rate, by province and territory</a></p>

        <h4>MAP YOUR FUTURE</h4>

        <p>CareerMapr is primarily focused on Canadian Youth who are faced with competitive labour markets in their hometowns for their choice of profession. Many youth are already doing the research and hitting the pavement to find relevant jobs in nearby cities or across the country. We want to make that process easier for them with data from Open Government Canada.</p>

        <p>CareerMapr can be improved with even more specific data sets like  industry trends and forecasts, community vibrancy and resilience, and skill gaps.  More data can help youth make informed decisions while mapping their futures across the country.</p>

        <p>Canadian youth are not the only ones to benefit. Small municipalities can use this app as a way to get the attention of young skilled Canadian workers. Eventually, we see governments, planners and policy makers drawing data from our CareerMapr and improving even more the employability of Canadian youth.</p>
